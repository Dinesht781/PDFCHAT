6.4 A letter grade, corresponding to the marks secured by the student is awarded for each 
course for which a student has registered. On obtaining a pass grade, the student 
accumulates the course credits as earned credits. A student’s performance is measured 
by the number of credits that the student has earned and the weighted grade point","To calculate the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), you can follow the formula provided in the context:

CGPA = (SGPA1 \* Ni + SGPA2 \* N2 + ... + SGPAk \* Nk) / (N1 + N2 + ... + Nk)

Where:

* SGPAi is the Semester Grade Point Average of the ith semester
* Ni is the number of credits taken by the student in the ith semester
* k is the number of semesters that the student has undergone

The SGPA is calculated as the sum of (Ci \* Pi) for all courses in the semester, divided by the sum of Ci for all courses in the semester.

Ci is the credit assigned to the ith course, and Pi is the grade point secured in the ith course.

1. Determine the credit (Ci) assigned to each of the 'n' courses that the student has registered for.
2. Determine the grade point (Pi) secured in each of the 'n' courses.
3. Calculate the sum of the products of the credit and grade point for all 'n' courses, i.e., ΣCiPi
4. Calculate the sum of the credits of all 'n' courses, i.e., ΣCi
5. The SGPA is then calculated as the ratio of the sum of the products of credit and grade points (ΣCiPi) to the sum of the credits (ΣCi).

Mathematically, it is represented as: SGPA = ΣCiPi / ΣCi

This calculation gives you the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) for a particular semester.",0.95489943,"To calculate SGPA, you need to multiply the credit assigned to each course by the grade point secured in that course, sum them up, and divide by the total credits.
